# Niki.ai-Internship_Assignment
Recently Manu visited the byteland. He was amazed with lots of different varieties of bytes he
encountered there. Seeing this, he thought of a problem: Given an integer n, find out total possible
bit string (either 0 or 1) of length n which don't have two contiguous zeroes in them. For example if n
= 3, then total possible bit strings are 5 {010, 011, 101, 110, 111}. Now Manu started solving
the problem but got busy with some important deployments. He asked you for the help. Please help
him figure out the solution.

Input Example:
2
2
3
Output Example:
3
5
Explanation:
For first test case (n = 2), the total possible bit strings are {01,10,11}. So answer is 3.
Second test case is same as provided in problem statement.
